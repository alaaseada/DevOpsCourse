Modern CI/CD setup
===================
	- Instead using Jenkins Master node on a server or EC2 instance, and Jenkins Worker nodes on VMs as well; which is high in cost 
	  and ineffecient in resource utilization, Just use Jenkins Master on Docker and run Docker Containers as needed and destroy them
	  once the job is done 
	- This solution is apropriate for small/medium scale applications 
	- Docker containers are very scalable and easy to be edited via the Docker file 


To setup this arch
==================
	- Follow the README file in this  https://github.com/iam-veeramalla/Jenkins-Zero-To-Hero
		- Create an EC2 Instance
		- Install Jenkins 
		- Edit SG add inbound port 8080
		- Configure and start Jenkins
		- Install docker.io
		- Grant permissions to jenkins user on docker daemon	
		- Restart jenkins http://IP:8080/restart
		- Install Docker pipeline plugin on Jenkins to allow using Docker as an Agent in case the Jenkins file stated that
