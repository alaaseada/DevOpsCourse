What does System Administrators do?
===================================
- In a scenario where a system Admin is managing a bunch of on premises servers (100) that run various OS (Win, RedHat, Ubuntu), he will be responsible 
  for:
	- Upgrading the system (Ex. CentOs 8 -> 9)
	- Install security patches  
	- Install SW as needed

 Issue
 =====
	- It will be a painful and tidious process to manually do these jobs on all servers
	- To do automatically via scripts, we need to write a script for each and every OS/distribution (using shell, PowerShell, etc.)
	- With the booming of Cloud services, the number of server has increased even more (10x)

 Configuration Management
 ========================
	- Is a concept that is to come over all issues above

	Tools
	======
	- Puppet
	- Chef
	- Ansible	-> The most popular / Developed by RedHat
	- Salt

 Puppet vs. Ansible
 ==================
			Puppet									Ansible
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      - Pull mechanism						- Push mechanism
		The Agents poll the Master at				Where the Devops Engineer write the Ansible playbook on his laptop 
		regular intervals for site/node config			for example and then push it to the instances to be configured
      - Master/Slave Arch					- Agentless Model
		Configure one machine as a Master			No configurations done on the agents Just put the DNS names/IP of the 
		and configure other machines as Slaves			machines in an inventory file and has the passwordless authentication enabled
								- Fully supported by Windows and Linux
      - Uses Puppet language which must be learned		- Uses YAML which is popular, simple to write, and easy to understand
								- One can develop Ansible modules (in Python) and share it via Ansible Galaxy for public use

 	SO) Ansible if much more convenient for automation because of the Agentless model (All we need is IP of node),
	    Moreover, a dynamic inventory file is a feature that can be configured that allows for detecting new agents 
	    and add them automatically to the inventory file 

	Disadvantages of Ansible
	========================
		- Harder to be done on Windows compared to Linux
		- Debugging is not easy to detect the issue
		- Performance issues with the increased number of agents to thousands
