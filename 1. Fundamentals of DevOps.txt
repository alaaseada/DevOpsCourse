Software Development Frameworks
===============================
In Software development there are 3 main framework that govern the process of Development and Delivery of SW
		
	- WaterFall
	===========
		Where the Software is analyzed -> ----------------Code--------------- -> Test -> Deploy 
		It is 
			- Sequential
			- Less favorable
			- More errors can be raised at the last stage which make it hard to be fixed rapidly
	- Agile
	=========
		Where the Software is Analyzed -> (Design -> Code -> Test) iteratively -> Deploy
		Allows for 
			- Less errorous code
			- Collaborative work
			- Faster deployments than Waterfall because of less errors
	- DevOps (CI/CD)
	================
		Is a philosophy (Culture) Where a team of operations and development takes the responsibility of the whole SW lifecycle to deliver 
		a SW in the most effecient and fast way through:
			- Automation
			- Maintaining Quality
			- Monitoring
			- Testing
		
		The iterative processes ""Design - Build - Test - Deploy"" are done automatically and include Deployments that can be daily or even hourly 
		DevOps allows for:
 			- More releases
			- Uses the Agile framework
			- Faster delivery

Why DevOps?
===========
- Before DevOps Software Development was a real pain specially when a large team is involved in the process.
- Developers had to manually move their code into a central repository to be built
- System Admin + Server Admins were needed to create and configure a server and its services to deploy the SW 
- Now DevOps shrink all this long process by leveraging the automation, IaaC, monitoring and testing 


Day to Day Tasks
=================
- To be a DevOps Engineer, start from where you are. Like if you are already a system administrator, be a DevOps system Admin, or Developer if you are a developer.
