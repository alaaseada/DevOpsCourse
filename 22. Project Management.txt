Agile Methodology
================
	- Unlike waterfall methodology in SW development, Agile aims to make the development cycle easy/fast and error free by breaking 
	  the project into small steps and add testing and deployment at the end of each sprint (short time that lasts from one to 4 weeks
	  and includes work from cross-functional teams like planning, designing, developing, testing and ends up with deploying a working 
	  feature and getting feedback from customers) instead of waiting till the end of the development of the whole project.
	  of the project.
	- Gains:
		- Individuals and interactions
		- Customer collab
		- Responding to changes
		- Working SW

Jira
====
	- Project Management Platform
	- Is a powerful platform that helps managing small/large SW projects  
	- Allows to track sprints and how much every one has done during a specific period of time 


Confleunce and SharePoint
=========================
	- Knowledge sharing Platforms
	- Simple example the documention of any internally used application that the Enterprise uses (like AWS docs, Jenkins, etc)

ServiceNow
==========
	- Is used for change and incedent management 
	- Incident management: for any reason, if an application encounters an issue and thanks to monitoring, every involved user will be notified
	  with the incident through an alert to take a corrective action as needed. This can be done automatically through integrating servicenow with
	  the monitoring system
	- Change management: Is a process of handling the required steps needed to make a change to a production environment

Read the Docs
=============
	- Is a free open-source plateform for static web hosting where we can share documentation 
	- It can be compared to SharePoint and Colfuence but it is not that rich as it is free and cannot be integrated with many tools as well
	- It integrates very well with Github

Git and Github
==============
	- Can also be used to manage projects and show their progress for progress tracking purposes
