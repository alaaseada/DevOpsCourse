1. What is DevOps?
	It is a philosophy/culture that aims for accelerating the SW delivery process via automation while maintaining high quality + testing and monitoring

2. Why to use Linux?
	Because it is:
	- Open source with amazing community support
	- Very very secure unlike other Os
	- Has various distributions that fit different users' tastes
	- Very efficient in handling resources which makes it fast

3. What is the Kernel in Linux?
	Kernel is the heart of the Linux OS because it is responsible for:
	- Device Managment
	- Memory Management
	- Process Management
	- System Calls Handling

4. What will be the output of date | echo "Today is " and why?
	Will be Today is. Because "date" is a system default command that sends the output to the stdin channel no stdout, thus the pipeline 
	will not get the output because it reads output from stdout channel.
	
	My Answer: Because echo does not read from stdin

5. What are the most commonly used shell commands in linux?
	- ls, mkdir, touch, cat, pwd, whoami, mv, rm, cp, curl, wget, grep, awk, find, df, free

6. Write a simple shell script to list all processes running
	ps -ef | awk '{print $2}'

7. Write a script to get only ERRORs from a remote log?
	curl <file_url>  | grep ERROR

8. How to debug a shell script?
	Use "set -x"	

9. What is crontab in Linux? Provide an example of its use cases
	Crontab is a command that allows scheduling tasks to automatically run in certain times 
	
10. How o open a read-only file?
	use "cat" command or vim -r

11. what is the difference between soft and hard links?
	hard links are copies of the original file. If the original file is deleted, the hard link files will keep working
	Soft links are aliases or shortcuts of the original files. If the original file deleted, the soft link will be inaccessible

12. what is the difference between BREAK and CONTINUE?
	BREAK, breaks the execution and exit
	CONTINUE, skip this execution and go to the next iteration

13. What are the different types of loops?
14. What are the disadvantages of shell scripting?

15. Is BASH is dynamically of statically typed and why?
	bash is a dynamically typed language, which means a variable can hold any value because we don't declare it a type at creation

16. How to sort names in a file?
	use "sort" command

17. How would you manage logs of a system that generates huge amount of logs every day?
	We can use the log rotation mechanism offered by "logrotate" command, which zip the logs after a configurable period of time
	and delete them after another configurable time

18. Why to go cloud?
	- Pay-as-you-go
	- No infrastructue management overhead
	- Go global in minutes
	- High scalability and availability

19. What are the benefits of version control systems (VCS)?
	1. Sharing code and merging different work from different developers 
	2. Versioning that allows for rollbacks and keeping various versions of SW

20. What are popular types of VCS and what are the differences between them?
	- CVS
	- SVN
	- GIT
	
	Centralized vs. Distributed VCs
	===============================
	Centralized 	-> like CVS and SVN, means that the source code is stored in a central server (Single Point of Failure) that is maintained 
			   by a single entity. Developers checkout the code, change it, and then commit it to this server

	Distributed	-> like GIT means that developers can create multiple copies of the central 
			   original code repo with the entire history on their local machines so they can modify the code, commit it to the local 
			   repo, then push the changes to the central server when possible

			   They are better because:
				- Avoid single point of failure
				- Great Flexibility
				- Faster development
				- Each developer is considered a backup (no need for central backup)
				- No permissions hustle on the server
21. What is Fork?
	- A fork is a copy of the entire original central repo "source code" to your account

22. What is the difference between Git and Github?
	- Git is a free, open source distributed version control system that can be installed in a server and let developers 
	  take snapshots of the original code, creating a version history. Then, they can share this snapshots and commits with other 
	  developers.The problem is the distributed nature of Git makes it difficult for developers to configure.

	- Github is a pay-for-use SaaS that allows companies to create a single, shared repository in their cloud, and that central 
	  GitHub repository becomes the source of truth for everyone on the team. Moreover, it has more additional features that Git
	  doesn't have:
		- User Management or user Authentication and authorization tools (token-based and MFA) which controls what a user can do 
		  in the git repo
		- Pages for free web hosting
		- Web-based Interface
		- Actions to help in CI/CD pipeline 

23. What is Feature branch?
		- Is a way to separate work on a new feature from production (main)
		- Scinaro, if a company has already delivered a product to cutomers and it now wanna add a new feature, they have to create a new
	  	  branch from the main/master branch -> add the new feature and test it well -> once confident merge it with the main branch, then 
	  	  delete it.

24. What is Release branch?
		- It is a branch we create once we need to deliver the product to the customer
		
		Q) Why not deliver from the main branch?
		   Because the main branch is open for active development. It might encounter a change while we are testing it. Thus, it is better
		   to create a release branch to keep it separated from changes in the master/main branch

25. What is HotFix branch?
		- Is a branch that is created to quickly fix an issue that is raised in the product delivered to customers

26. What is the branch that has to be always updated?
	- All changes done to any of the feature, release, or hotfix branches must be reflected to the master/main branch

27. How to initialize a Git repo and what happened after it?
	- Use "git init" which creates a folder called ".git" that contains hooks, objects, HEAD, refs

28. What is the normal workflow in a git repo?
	- Create a local repo "git init"
	- Do the work needed
	- Add the files to the repo tracking "git add"
	- Check the status of your tracked files "git status"
	- If there are any changes, just check them using "git diff"
	- Commit the changes to the local repo and add a message to it "git commit -m"
	- Check the remote repo "git remote -v"
	- If there is one 
		- Push the changes to it "git push remote local"
	  Else
		- Add the remote repo refernece "git remote add <name><url>
		- Then push the changes "git push <remote><local>"

29. How to get code from an organization's repo?
	- By cloning the repo. 
		- Go to the GUI
		- Get the Repo URL and use "git clone https://github.com/iam-veeramalla/shell-scripting-projects.git"
		- Provide the username and the password of your git
OR)
	- Use SSH
		- Create a new key-pair for your working machine via ssh-keygen
		- Copy the public key
		- Create a new SSH in Github & paste the copied SSH key
		- git clone git@github.com:iam-veeramalla/shell-scripting-projects.git

30. What is the difference between CLONE and FORK?
	- CLONE is used to download the code in a repository
	- FORK is used to copy the repository in order to create a distributed versions of it 
		- NOTE: if the original repo is updated, the forked copy will not be changed unless we do it manually

31. What is the difference between Merge, rebase and cherry-pick?
	- Cherry-pick is the easiest option it is done manually for each commit, which makes it suitable only if we have few # of commits
