 - For a DevOps Engineer who needs 10 virtual machines, he can create these machines manually or automatically
 - As a DevOps Eng, automation is the key
 - For this mission, he can select the platform he will use first and then decide which tool he'll use to automate this process. 
   
 Infrastructure as a Code (IaaC)
=================================	
   Ex:
	AWS		-> AWS CloudFormation Template (CFT)
	Azure		-> Azure Resource Manager
	On premises	-> OpenStack Heat Template
	Hybrid		-> Learn and write scripts using 2 or more of the above tools

 Drawback
 =========
	- If by time, he decided to change the platform, all the written scripts would have to be written again using the new tool

 Solution
 =========
	- Use a platform-independent tool like Terraform

 Terraform (API as a Code)
 =========================
	- Is a tool that allows writing IaaC scripts that can work on any Cloud Provider with minimum amount of modifications
	  which is called "API as a Code"
	- API is an intefrace that allows interacting with the App via scripts/commands
	- Terraform converts our code to API calls that matches the provider we configured 
	- It saves time of re-writing scripts and time of DevOps Engineers to learn more than one tool
