Branching strategy
==================
	1. Feature branch
		- Is a way to separate work on a new feature from production (main)
		- Scinaro, if a company has already delivered a product to cutomers and it now wanna add a new feature, they have to create a new
	  	  branch from the main/master branch -> add the new feature and test it well -> once confident merge it with the main branch, then 
	  	  delete it.
	2. Release branch
		- It is a branch we create once we need to deliver the product to the customer
		
		Q) Why not deliver from the main branch?
		   Because the main branch is open for active development. It might encounter a change while we are testing it. Thus, it is better
		   to create a release branch to keep it separated from changes in the master/main branch
	3. HotFix branch
		- Is a branch that is created to quickly fix an issue that is raised in the product delivered to customers

	Note
	=====
	- All changes done to any of these branches must be reflected to the master/main branch because it has to be always up-to-date
