How to create a virtual machine?
================================
	
	- On primses 
		- Install a hypervisor (VMWare for example)
		- Create a new VM
	OR)

	- Connect to a Cloud Provider of your choise for example
		- Amazon AWS 
		- Microsoft Azure
		- Google Cloud 
	  via its Console/portal, and create a new Cloud Computing Unit Ex. EC2 on AWS via 

	What the DevOps Engineer will do?
	===================================
	- Create a script which makes a call with a request to AWS EC2 API to create for example 10 EC2 instances 
		How the DevOps Engineer write the script?
		=========================================
		Using
			- AWS CLI
			- AWS API (Ex. Boto 3 in Python)
			- AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit)
			- AWS CFT (Cloud Formation Template)
			- TERRAFORM which can automate infrastructure for any Cloud Provider
	- AWS will validate the request to make sure that it is authenticated and authorized, then responses back with the instances 

	Note	
	====
	- Don't ever use a tool because it is popular instead use the one that fits into your requirments and environment 
	- For Example, working in a complete AWS environment will dictate using AWS tool over Terraform because it will get the support from AWS first in case any new product is launched
	- Another Example, in case of having a Hybrid Cloud Model in the company, Terraform will be the best choice because it is platform independent 
	
	Benefits
	=========
	- This will automate the creation of VMs and saves time 
	- Also because of the automation, less errors might raise
