What is Operating System?
=========================
 - OS is a medium of communication between SW and HW
	Ex. the layer between SW like Office, Jenkins, etc and RAM, I/O or HD

Why Linux is very popular?
==========================
	- An Open Source SW
	- Very secure
	- Varios distributions that fit any user
	- Very fast because it is very efficient in managing resources  

Linux OS Structure
====================
3. user programs 4. system software 5. compilers
2. System Libraries
1. Kernel


Where:
======
	- Kernel 
		- Is the heart of Linux OS because it is responsible for establishing the communication between SW and HW
		- Has 4 primary responsibilities:
			1. Device Management 
			2. Memory Management
			3. Process Management
			4. Handling System Calls
	- System Libraries
		- Are responsible for performing a task
		- Ex. libc 
	- Compilers
		- That are used for specific programming languages to be compiled
	- User programs, system SW 
		- SW that the user needs or the system needs


Shell Scripting Fundamentals
============================
Shell is a computer program called the Command Line Interpreter that lets Linux users control their operating system via commands 


Most commonly used commands
===========================
	- ls		List file or folders
	- mkdir		Create a new dir
	- pwd		Show where we stand
	- whoami	Show who is the current user
	- cd 		Change the current dir
	- cat		Show file content
	- vi		Create a new file and write in it
	- rm		Remove file or dir (-r)
	- nproc		Watch # of CPUs used
	- free -g	Watch Memory
	- df -h		Disk free
	- top		Watch all disk, memory, and cpu in one place
	- man		Show the manual page of a command

What is the Scripting role in automation?
=========================================
Scripting allows for doing the repeated and tidious tasks automatically without intervention which will make any process faster

	Ex
	===
 	- Create 20 files named file_num.tx 
	  Manually: $ touch file_1.txt .......
	  Script: $ touch file_{1..1000000}.txt

How to create a shell script file?
==================================
	$ touch script.sh
	$ vi script.sh
	
	- First line in the script must be shebang followed by the executable of the shell defining which program is gonna handle the following commands

	  #!/bin/[sh|bash|dash|ksh]		There are syntax differences between these executables, the most commonly used one is bash
						sh was linked previously to bash but be careful that in ubuntu lately it is linked to dash
	- Write any commands you want to execute in the script 
		mkdir ~/automated
		cd ~/automated
		touch script_{1..3}.sh

	- Save and exit	
	
	Notes
	====
	- To execute the script, you have to have an execution permission 
		$ chmod 700 script.sh
	- To run the executable
		$ ./script.sh or 
		$ sh script.sh


DevOps tasks
=============
	- Infrastructure maintenance
	- Code maintenance (git)
	- Configuration management 

All of these tasks are done using shell

Example
========
- John is a DevOps Engineer who is working in Amazon
- He has 10000 VMs to maintain
- He writes a shell script that to be executed in a specific schedule to check the health of the nodes and send the result to him via mail
- The result for example came with machine 9999 is out of memory
