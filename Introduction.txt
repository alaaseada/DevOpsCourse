What is DevOps?
===============

In Software development there are 3 main framework that govern the process of Development and Delivery of SW
		
	- WaterFall
	===========
		Where the Software is analyzed -> ----------------Code--------------- -> Test -> Deploy 
		It is 
			- Sequential
			- Less favorable
			- More errors can be raised at the last stage which make it hard to be fixed rapidly
	- Agile
	=========
		Where the Software is Analyzed -> (Design -> Code -> Test) iteratively -> Deploy
		Allows for 
			- Less errorous code
			- Collaborative work
			- Faster deployments than Waterfall because of less errors
	- DevOps (CI/CD)
	================
		Is a philosophy Where a team of operations and development takes the responsibility of the whole SW lifecycle to deliver 
		a SW in the most effecient and fast way. 
		
		The iterative processes are done automatically and include Deployments that can be daily or even hourly 
 		Analyzed -> (Design -> Code -> Test -> Deploy (release)) iteratively 
			- More releases
			- Uses the Agile framework
			- Faster delivery

CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery or Deployment)
================================================================
Is a DevOps Software Development practices that automates the SD lifecycle tasks to get a higher quality of SW and faster SD cycle

	- CI
	  Continuously merge code from different code commits into a single shared repository and make it ready for the upcoming automated
	  building and testing 
	- CD
		- Delivery
		  Create a release and wait for an approval (human intervention) before being deployed in production
 
		- Deployment
		  SW is pushed to production automatically after been tasted (No human intervention)


	The pipeline = 						==> CDelivery (Manual) to production environment
		CI (Build + Test) ==> Staging Deployment ==> 
								==> CDeployment (automatically) to production environment


Most commonly used CI/CD tools
==============================
	- Jenkins
	- CircleCI
	- GitLab
	- Travis CI
	- Bambo
	- Argo
	- Buddy

What does Cloud Native mean?
============================
	- It means that we are developing SW that can take advantage of the Cloud Computing Foundation and use the public/private/or hybrid cloud.
	- If the application is running in a container or if it is an API for example, we can call the application a Cloud Native App

DevSecOps
=========
	Equals the DevOps + Security 
	= IT Operations + Deployment + Delivery + Security

IaaC
===
	- Infrastructure as a Code is a very important pillar of DevOps where we can Manage/Provision HW via configuration/definition files 
	- Those files can be automatically deployed on Cloud Infrastructure or even on premises 
	- TERAFORM is the most commonly used tool for IaaC because it is platform independent. It can work on AWS, Azure, Alibaba, IBM, or on premises

SRE
===
	- Site Reliability Engineers are those who take the responsibility of ensuring the delivery of a reliable/stable releases that meet
	  the business goals of the SW where,
		- Developers	-> Focus on produce frequent releases and updates
		- Operations	-> Focus on keeping the application stable and reliable despite of the number of updates
		- DevOps	-> Focus on the fast delivery of the updates despite of its reliablity
		
	- So the SRE is the practice that fill the gap among these teams by using system management, and application monitoring tools
