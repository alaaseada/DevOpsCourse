What is Docker?
==============	
				-------------------------------------------------------------------------
				| "Containerization is a concept or technology and Docker Implements it" |
				------------------------------------------------------------------------
Docker is a containerization platform that provides easy way to containerize your applications, which means, using Docker you can build container 
images, run the images to create containers and also push these containers to container registries such as DockerHub, Quay.io and so on.

Docker LifeCycle
================
There are three important things,

    docker build	-> builds docker images from Dockerfile
    docker run		-> runs container from docker images
    docker push		-> push the container image to public/private registries to share the docker images

Docker terminology 
==================
	- Docker daemon	-> Service that listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects and it can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services.
	- Docker client	-> Primary way that Docker users interact with Docker. It takes the commands (using DockerAPI) from the user and sends them to the daemon
	- Docker Desktop-> An easy-to-install application for all OSs' environment that enables building and sharing containerized applications and microservices. 
			   It includes the Docker daemon (dockerd), the client (docker), Compose, Content Trust, Kubernetes, and Credential Helper. 
	- Docker registries -> A storage for Docker images. Ex. Docker Hub which is a public/default registry of Docker that anyone can use
			       Private registries can be created and used instead (via PUSH and PULL commands)

	- Dockerfile	-> A file where you provide the steps to build your Docker Image.
			   Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer in the image
			   Changing something in the Dockerfile a rebuilding it, will rebuild the changed parts only
	- Images	-> Are a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. Often, an image is based on another image, 
			   with some additional customization

Installtion and usage
=====================
 After installing Docker make sure that:
	- The daemon is running 
		- if not, run and enable it
	- The user has sufficient permissions to interact with docker 
		- if not, add the user to the group "docker" 

Commands
========
	docker run hello-world			check the installation
