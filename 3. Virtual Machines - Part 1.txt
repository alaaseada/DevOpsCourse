What is a Server?
================
A Server is a machine that has powerful resources and can provide services to users like File server, Web Server, Database Server, etc.

What is Virtualization?
=======================
Is a technology that allows using the host's resources efficiently by sharing it with other guest

	How it works?
	=============
	It depends on a Hypervisor SW that allow creating VMs that are logically separated by sharing Physical resources of the Host with the Guest machines 
	
	Types
	=====
		- Type 1: Where the hypervisor runs as a lightweight operating system directly on the HW (Bare Metal) layer of the Host machine
			- Layer 1 - Physical Resources
	 		- Layer 2 - Hypervisor Software 	
	 		- Layer 3 - Guest OS
	 		- Layer 4 - Applications	
		- Type 2: Where the hypervisor runs as a software layer on an operating system
	 		- Layer 1 - Physical Resources
	 		- Layer 2 - Host OS
	 		- Layer 3 - Hypervisor Software 	
	 		- Layer 4 - Guest OS
	 		- Layer 5 - Applications

		Note:
		=====
		- Type 1 is a bit more complicated in installation ana maintenance that type 2 but it saves alot of resources  

	
	Why it is part of DevOps?
	=========================
	Because it allows for efficient utilization of resources through automation

	Popular Hypervisors
	===================
	- VMWare
	- HyperV


Cloud and virtualization
========================
Many technology enterprises like AMAZON, GOOGLE, MICROSOFT and IBM build their own computing insfrastructure (Data Centers) with thousands or millions of physical servers, 
which are then used as host machines for VMs that are rented by customer over the internet (IaaS)

Most popular Cloud providers
============================
	- Amazon AWS
	- Google Cloud 
	- Microsoft Azure
	- Redhat OpenStack
